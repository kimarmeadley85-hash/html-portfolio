<h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime series. The story is really strong with good character development and plot layering</p>

<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>This is the one of the animes that got me into this genre</p>

<h3>Samurai X</h3>
<p>This is pure store story telling magic. Older graphics however sound development.</p>

<h3>Naruto</h3>
